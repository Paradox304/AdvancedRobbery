# AdvancedRobbery
##### How does it work
1. Players can rob players that are in a certain radius of them set in the config.
2. Set if the the one being robbed should be surrendered or not when being robbed.
3. Set the base chance of a robbing being successsfull, set how much a chance goes up because of a group member in that certain radius of the player and how much should a chance go down because of certain people that are not the group member of that player.
4. Set if the group members involved in the robbery (the ones in the radius) should get cooldown with the robber as well.
5. Set if the robbery successes should the one being robbed auto drop items and if so how many items should the guy drop. (Items will be randomized from their inventory with guns taking a higher percentage).
6. Recommended to set the cooldown to atleast a minute, as spamming the rob command with no cooldown can lag the server out.

#### Commands
/rob (player name) = Rob a player. (Permission: rob)
